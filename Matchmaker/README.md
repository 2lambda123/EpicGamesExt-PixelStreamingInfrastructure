### Where is matchmaker?
The matchmaker has been removed. It was not a good refernce for how to handle Pixel Streaming at scale and was adding to maintenance work, so we made the decision to remove it and discontinue its support.

### What if I still need Matchmaker?
The matchmaker can be obtained from older releases or other branches. It was removed in preparation for UE5.5 so anything below that will have it.
